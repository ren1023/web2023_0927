            Just shoot for the stars If it feels right
            And aim for my heart If you feel like
            And take me away, make it okay
            I swear I'll behave
            
            You wanted control So we waited
            I put on a show Now I make it
            You say I'm a kid My ego is big
            I don't give a shit
            
            And it goes like this
            
            Take me by the tongue And I'll know you
            Kiss me till you're drunk And I'll show you
            You want the moves like jagger
            I got the moves like jagger
            I got the mooooooves... like jagger
            
            I don't need to try to control you
            Look into my eyes and I'll own you
            With them the moves like jagger
            I got the moves like jagger
            I got the mooooooves... like jagger
            
            Maybe it's hard
            When you feel like you're broken and scarred
            Nothing feels right But when you're with me
            I make you believe That I've got the key
            
            So get in the car We can ride it
            Wherever you want Get inside it
            And you want to steer But I'm shifting gears
            I'll take it from here And it goes like this
            
            Take me by the tongue And I'll know you
            Kiss me till you're drunk And I'll show you
            You want the moves like jagger
            I got the moves like jagger
            I got the mooooooves... like jagger
            
            I don't need to try to control you
            Look into my eyes and I'll own you
            With them the moves like jagger
            I got the moves like jagger
            I got the mooooooves... like jagger
            
            You wanna know how to make me smile
            Take control, own me just for the night
            And if I share my secret
            You're gonna have to keep it
            Nobody else can see this
            
            So watch and learn
            I won't show you twice
            Head to toe, ooh baby, roll me right
            And if I share my secret
            You're gonna have to keep it
            Nobody else can see this
            
            And it goes like this
            
            Take me by the tongue And I'll know you
            Kiss me till you're drunk And I'll show you
            You want the moves like jagger
            I got the moves like jagger
            I got the mooooooves... like jagger
            
            I don't need to try to control you

            With them the moves like jagger
            I got the moves like jagger
